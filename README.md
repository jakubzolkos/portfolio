Welcome to my portfolio, a place where you can find my latest projects and learn more about my skills and experience.

## Technologies Used
- React
- TailwindCSS
- EmailJs

## Installation
To get started, you'll need to have `npm` installed on your computer. If you don't have it, you can download it from [the npm website](https://www.npmjs.com/).

To install all the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

'
npm install react @emailjs/browser tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch
'

Once you have installed all the necessary dependencies, you can start the development server by running:

npm start

This will start a local development server and open the portfolio in your default web browser. You can now make changes to the code and see them automatically update in the browser.

To build the production version of the portfolio, run:

npm run build

This will create a `build` folder with the optimized production version of the portfolio.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio, feel free to take a look around and do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to work together.
